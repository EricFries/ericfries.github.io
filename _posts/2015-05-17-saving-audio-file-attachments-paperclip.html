title: Saving Audio File Attachments with the Paperclip Gem
---

<a href="https://feedbackmusicapp.com"><img src="http://ericfries.github.io/images/feedback.png"></a>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 90%">This is the second in a series of posts about <a href="https://feedbackmusicapp.com">Feedback</a>, a collaborative audio recording app that works entirely in the browser.  Feedback allows musicians to create multi-track audio projects that other members of the Feedback community can add tracks to.  Project owners have the power to "curate" their projects and can keep or delete tracks added by the community.  Feedback recommends projects to contribute to based on the user's primary musical instrument and the project owner's instrument preferences.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ericfries.github.io/uploading-audio-using-formdata-and-ajax/">first post</a> about <a href="https://feedbackmusicapp.com">Feedback</a>, discussed uploading audio files to a Rails backend using FormData objects and Ajax calls.  The next step in building Feedback was figuring how to save uploaded files and associate them with our Track model.</p> 

<h2>Uploading Files To Rails? Use Paperclip</h2>
<p>A great Rails gem to associate attachments with objects is  <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip </a>.  It's frequently used to upload creepy cat photos to blogs, but can be used with other files types like audio.  After adding Paperclip to the Gemfile, a few tweaks need to be made to the model that it's being used with.</p>

<p>Here's what we added to our Track model to get Paperclip working:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
 has_attached_file :audio
validates_attachment_content_type :audio, :content_type => [ 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/x-mpeg', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/x-mp3', 'audio/mpeg3', 'audio/x-mpeg3', 'audio/mpg', 'audio/x-mpg', 'audio/x-mpegaudio' ]
{% endhighlight %}    

<p>The <code>has_attached_file :audio</code> line of code gives Track objects an <code>audio</code> attribute that maps to the audio file being uploaded.  So <code>track.audio</code> (assuming track is an instance of the Track class) will return a <code>Paperclip::Attachment</code> object.  According to the <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/paperclip/Paperclip/ClassMethods">Paperclip documentation</a>, this object is intended to handle the management of the attached file.  And it does!  So <code>track.audio.url</code> returns the url where the file is saved.  This means easy access to urls and no hard coding which is really great.</p>

<p>The <code> validates_attachment_content_type :audio</code> line of code adds an Active Record validation that only allows certain file types to be attached.  This ensures that a photo or other non-audio file doesn't accidentally (or maliciously) get associated with a Track object. </p>


<p>Since the uploaded audio file is already hitting the <code>create</code> action in the Tracks controller (as <code>params['data']</code>), the audio file can be assigned to a new Track object like any other model attribute:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
@track = Track.create(audio: mp3_file)
{% endhighlight %} 

<p>You might be wondering where the audio file is actually being saved since relational databases (we're using Postgres) aren't typically used to store binary data.  Here we've set up Paperclip (in its initializer file) to store the actual audio with S3 (here's a <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3">good guide </a> from Heroku on how to get that working).</p>

<h2>Garbage Audio is Deleted</h2>
<p>Another really cool thing is that attached files are automatically deleted when the object they are associated with is deleted.  It's similar to <code>dependent: :destroy</code> functionality that can be used to delete objects that belong to an object being deleted (e.g., when posts are deleted from a blog, associated comments are also deleted).  Automatically deleting unnecessary audio files means storage space is free of garbage and is nicely conserved.</p>

<p>Now that audio is being uploaded with Rails using FormData, and persisted to S3 using the Paperclip gem, the next post will explain how to send the audio tracks back to the browser (without refreshing!) so they can be played by the user.</p>
