<p>Git's branches are amazing tools that allow developers to test new features without wreaking havoc on code that already works.  When combined with GitHub, branches are especially useful to developers who need to merge their work with collaborators.   </p>

<p>  As a new developer, I'm frequently in the mindset of following established rules and trusting that certain techniques and concepts just work.  I don't need to know every detail about how something works, but I do get a little freaked out when I have no idea how something works. And until now, I had no idea how Git branches actually worked.</p>

<h4>Git Init</h4>
<p>Transforming a normal directory into a local git repository requires the utterance of two magic words:  "git init."  This command places hidden files into the directory I'm in when I execute the command.  Let's try this first bit of voodoo magic out:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/a6897adad817569ff9c7.js"></script>

<p>Now that I've run "git init,"" I'm automatically in the "master" branch of my local repository. I can verify this by using the "git status" command.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/bc1c454a9074099f0f15.js"></script>

<p>I'd like to start writing a textfile in this directory that I'll later use as the body of a blog post.  So I start editing a new textfile called post.txt in my text editor. Here's how my file currently stands:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/ca7cf98267f759d41c5a.js"></script>

<h4>Git Add and Commit</h4>

<p>Importantly, I tell Git to "stage" this file by using the "git add ." command, and git takes a snapshot of the file's current state when I run the "git commit -m" command with a message about what I did to the file.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/932cbd7cded3ac770cc1.js"></script>

<h4>Creating a New Git Branch</h4>
<p>Now I'm wavering.  I want to make changes to my post's text, but I don't want to lose any of my previous work in the event it's actually groundbreaking.  Enter Git branches.  I'll make a new Git branch called "experimental-theories" and switch into that branch to flesh out some new ideas:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/1441eede2f85dd0cde4a.js"></script>

<p>Predicably, when I open the original textfile again, it still looks exactly as I left it:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/ca7cf98267f759d41c5a.js"></script>

<p>Git hasn't made any changes to the file.  Now I'm ready to expand on my post so I make a few changes:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/d13986cc667fcc209a05.js"></script>

<p>And I simultaneously stage and take another snapshot of the file's evolution at this moment in time with the "git commit -am" command:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/d67aceea7e0d48e4ea9f.js"></script>

<p>However, at this point, I'd like to go back to my post as it stood in the master branch.  It's more concise, and less political.  So I simply switch back to my "master" branch:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/b65add278eb4cec808e0.js"></script>

<p>And voila, when I open the text file, I have the original version back:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/ca7cf98267f759d41c5a.js"></script>

<p>This is where things get a little mind-bending. How is Git able to do this?  You might be thinking that if I opened my Finder, and opened the directory containing the textfile, that there might actually be two textfiles.  You may even be thinking that Git secretly created a "master" branch directory and an "experimental-theories" branch directory, and that each exists as a parallel universe with their own version of the textfile I've been modifying.  At least, that's what I thought, and I was wrong.</p>

<p>Just to refresh, let's switch over to my "experimental-theories" branch and see what the post.txt file looks like there:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/EricFries/cb0e0640bb06af9bb95e.js"></script>

<p>And there's the longer version of my post.txt file again.</p>

<p>So how many versions of this post.txt file are there?  There is exactly one post.txt file.  But this is troubling because when I switch back and forth between branches I'm seeing different versions of post.txt.  </p>

<p>
This is the magic of Git.  Remember those snapshots of post.txt I took using "git commit?"  Every time I switch the branch I'm working in, Git uses these snapshots to modify the one, singular post.txt to look exactly as it did according to the last snapshot taken in the branch I'm switching to.  Whether I open post.txt via Finder or Terminal, the file will be modified according to the commit "snapshots" taken in the branch I'm currently in.</p>

<p>Of course, a much more technical explanation of this phenomenon can be found in the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">official Git documentation</a> which confirms that switching branches actually modifies the working directory.</p>
