title: Ruby Design Patterns, The Observer

<img src="http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/images/Fringe_Observer_binoculars.jpg">
<p>One of the things that makes object-oriented programming fun is the ability to have objects send messages to each other.  Sure, it's amusing to make dog and people classes or bank account and transaction classes, but the magic happens when objects of these classes interact.  It is particularly useful for objects to communicate with each other when their state has changed.  If you need a refresher, the concept of "state" is a key principle of object-oriented programming, and <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Overview">it's an object's instance variables that hold the state of that object.</a>
</p>

<h2>Observer</h2>
<p>It turns out that there is a well-developed design pattern called the "observer" that streamlines the exchange of messages between objects.  It works like this: <blockquote>An object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. - <a href="https://github.com/nslocum/design-patterns-in-ruby">Nick Slocum</a></blockquote></p>

<p>The observer design pattern is so ubiquitous that there is an <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html">Observable module</a> in Ruby.  Let's try to implement the observer design pattern (without the module) between two objects that exchange messages in the real world, the driver of a car and its gas tank.  This is a really important concept, unless you're trying to see how low the needle can go...</p>

<p>A <code>GasTank</code> object will be our subject whose responsibility it is to maintain a list of observers (here it will have one, a <code>Driver</code>). Maintaining a list of observers is not enough, however.  The <code>GasTank</code> must also notify them if there is a change in the <code>GasTank</code>'s state.  The specific change in state we want to observe is a change in the <code>GasTank</code>'s level. Here's our <code>GasTank</code> class:</p>  

{% highlight ruby %}
class GasTank
  attr_accessor :level, :observers

  def initialize
    @level = "not empty"
    @observers = []
  end

  def develop_leak
    @level = "empty"
    notify_observers
  end

  def add_observer(observer)
    @observers << observer
  end

  def notify_observers
    observers.each do |observer|
      observer.update(self)
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The instance variable <code>@level</code> will hold the state of the <code>GasTank</code> object, i.e., the <code>GasTank</code> is either "empty" or "not empty."  We want to communicate a change in this state to the <code>Driver</code> so let's get the <code>Driver</code> class set up.</p>

{%highlight ruby%}
class Driver
  def update(gastank)
    if gastank.level == "empty"
      puts "Time to get gas.  The tank is #{gastank.level}."
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>Driver update</code> method receives an instance of <code>GasTank</code>, and will print a statement to the screen based on the change in the <code>GasTank</code>'s state.  Now I'll instantiate an instance of both the <code>GasTank</code> and <code>Driver</code> classes:</p>
{%highlight bash%}
 > gastank = GasTank.new
 => #<GasTank:0x007fee621c6ad0 @level="not empty", @observers=[]> 
> driver = Driver.new
 => #<Driver:0x007fee621be218>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>To get these objects to start communicating, we'll need to invoke <code>add_observer</code> on <code>gastank</code> while passing in <code>driver</code>.</p>

{%highlight bash%}
> gastank.add_observer(driver)
 => [#<Driver:0x007fee62194120>]
 {% endhighlight %}

 <p>This properly pushed the <code>driver</code> object into the <code>gastank</code>'s <code>observers</code> array.  Since we now have an observer, we can call <code>notify_observers</code> on <code>gastank</code> if there is a change in state.  This method iterates through the <code>observers</code> array, and calls <code>update</code> on each object in that array.</p>

 <p>I've conveniently defined the method <code>develop_leak</code> in the <code>GasTank</code> class that will cause a change in state.  When <code>develop_leak</code> is invoked, <code>@level</code> is changed from its default of "not empty" to "empty."  This method also automatically invokes the <code>notify_observers</code> method discussed above.</p>
{%highlight bash%}
 > gastank.develop_leak
Time to get gas.  The tank is empty.
 => [#<Driver:0x007fee62194120>] 
  {% endhighlight %}

  <p>And just like that, our objects are talking to each other, and we've implemented a basic version of the observer design pattern.</p>
